🛡️ Token-Gated Access Control (TGAC) Smart Contract
A modular smart contract for managing decentralized access to digital content and resources, gated by fungible token ownership. This contract supports tiered access, community permissions, time- and usage-based restrictions, and flexible administrative control.

📚 Overview
The TGAC Contract enables decentralized platforms to restrict access to resources based on:

Ownership of specific tokens

Membership in token-based communities

Access tiers with varying privileges

Time-based and usage-based conditions

This smart contract is ideal for:

Token-gated media platforms

Decentralized SaaS models

NFT or token membership clubs

DAO-controlled content

⚙️ Core Features
✅ Token-Based Access
Supports whitelisted fungible tokens with configurable minimum balances for access eligibility.

📊 Tiered Access Control
Four predefined tiers:

BASIC (u1)

PREMIUM (u2)

VIP (u3)

FOUNDER (u4)

Each tier can have its own:

Token requirement

Access duration (in blocks)

Usage limits

Feature list

🕒 Time- and Usage-Based Restrictions
Configure resources to expire after a set number of blocks or a number of accesses.

👥 Community-Based Access
Communities are groups identified by a shared token contract and minimum balance requirement.

Resources can be shared with entire communities.

Membership and participation are tracked on-chain.

🛠 Administrative Controls
Contract Ownership: Transferable control

Token Management: Add and update supported token contracts

Resource Management: Add, activate, and configure resources

🧩 Contract Structure
📌 Constants
Error codes and tier levels are defined for consistency and validation.

❗ Error Codes

Code	Description
u100	Not authorized
u101	Resource already exists
u102	Resource not found
u103	Token contract not supported
u104	Insufficient token balance
u105	Access expired
u106	No access rights
u107	Max uses reached
u108	Invalid time period
u109	Invalid access tier
u110	Member already exists
🧪 Example Use Cases
Premium Content Delivery: Provide different levels of access based on how many tokens a user holds.

Community Collaboration: Allow DAO members to access shared tools or documentation.

Subscription Models: Create content that expires after a time or a limited number of uses.

NFT Utilities: Enable token holders to unlock digital experiences or tools.

🔐 Security Considerations
Only the contract owner can update supported tokens or transfer ownership.

Access control logic is protected by assertions with meaningful error codes.

Token contract addresses must be explicitly registered and activated.
